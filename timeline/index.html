				<h2>Week One</h2>
				<p>The EPICS TORCH Team had their maiden meeting. The members were introduced to each other and the team’s advisor and teaching assistant. Dr. Sean Brophy gave a brief explanation of what the goals and expectations of the team were. In the second hour, the meeting was taken over by Dr. Timonthee L. Pourpoint, a professor from the school of aeronautics and astronautics. Professor Pourpoint gave presentation on the Indiana Bicentennial Torch Relay and the specifications of the torch we would be designing. Specifications that were discussed during the meeting were LED flames, potential electronics features, materials and more. The meeting was adjourned with members of the team leaving Armstrong with a better idea of what the project would demand.</p>

				<h2>Week 2</h2>
				<p>The TORCH Team brainstormed for ideas on the design and function of the torch. We thought of bunch of ideas that we can incorporate into the torch such as cameras, audio speakers, GPS, touch screen interface and more. Our ideas were mapped into a functional block diagram to keep track of the ideas. The second meeting also saw roles assigned to the members of the team. The torch team was divided into mechanical team and electrical team. The mechanical team was responsible for looking into the shape and material of the torch housing while the electrical team analyzed the electric components of the beacon. The meeting was adjourned with the team doing research on the torch during </p>
